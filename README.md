# Module15
This is my Module 15 challenge
##
In this challenge, I was tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS earthquake data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. 
##
To do this, I needed to create a map with the following features:
 -The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
 -Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
 -Create a legend that will provide context for my map data.
##

Everything went pretty smoothly for me in this assignment, until I got to the legend. Going off the student bike leaflet activity in class I didn't have much luck getting the same results with this dataset. I used Stack Overflow and google searches to find out how to create the legend to work with this dataset, using 'i' to loop through the depths instead of making categories like he did in the activity. In my head it should have worked the same in this one, but I was obviously doing something wrong. So this way I learned something new I guess. 
##
If you open the index.html from VS code, it should work on either the live server or the default browser. 
The logic.js file is located in the "js" folder 
The style.css file is located in the "css" folder, and the data was fetched from the USGS website.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
